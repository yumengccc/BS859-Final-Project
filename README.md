# BS859-Final-Project
## The potential association between Rheumatoid Arthritis and Type 1 Diabetes
It's a self-chosen independent project.

## Background: 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) are all known as the autoimmune disease, as the fact that many patients were diagnosed with both two traits. Therefore, these two traits may share some common genetic variants or may have any causal relationships. And conducting analysis to evaluate the potential common genetic factors provide an insight into the shared biological mechanisms of them and may contribute to the new therapy approaches for RA or T1D diseases.

## Methods: 
(1) Explore the relationship between RA and T1D by estimating their genetic correlation (using LD score regression).  
(2) Assessing the predictive ability of T1D-associated variants for RA risk (using PRS analysis).  
(3) Investigating the potential causal relationships between the two diseases (using the Bi-directional Mendelian randomization analysis).   
The three methods could provide different perspectives on the associations between 2 traits.  
(4) Multi-trait meta-analysis.  

## Data: 	
(1) GWAS RA, a GWAS of self-reported Rheumatoid Arthritis in the UK Biobank.  
(2) GWAS T1D, a genome-wide association study of type 1 diabetes (T1D) using 520,580 European samples.  
(3) PLINK format files for NARAC RA (for PRS analysis).  
(4) UK Biobank LD scores (for LD score regression).
